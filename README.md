# HotCalloutsV

This is a branch from HotCallouts that upgrades HotCallouts from GTA IV LCPDFR to GTA V LSPDFR.

## Why Upgrade

The LCPDFR is unsupported. Fortunately, I received a legitimate copy of GTA V allows me to develop, play, test plugins and mods for GTA V.

Also, I hate unstable of GTA IV - One small move can crash the whole game, or LCPDFR - for example, `EquipWeapon` method can and will crash the game, and you can only play LCPDFR about 30 minutes before it crashes and you need to restart to play again.

## Callouts

This project aimed to recreate all of the call-outs in original IV version. The IV version is updated - but only bug fixes and only small callouts will be added to IV version, and after this project completed recreation and successfully added 10 callouts based on completed callouts, the IV version will only receive bug fixes, and then, dropped.
